algorithms used:
Background Subtraction:MOG
Optical Flow.

Video is captured then this video is converted into frames .Implementing Background Subtraction algo we differentiated 
the moving objects from Background using gaussian mixtures.MOG n MOG2 methods.
Once we got the separated moving objects we implemented the optical flow TVL1 method to check the flow of the vehicles
which gives the time a vehicle takes to cover the distance in the frames 
the threshold is 60 frames.
Total distance covered in that frame is fixed hereby we got velocities after 2 sec then we have taken the average velocity.
wich is our final output.
frame rate is 30frame per sec.
