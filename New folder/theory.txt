The short explanation is, sparse techniques only need to process some pixels from the whole image, 
dense techniques process all the pixels. Dense techniques are slower but can be more accurate, 
but in my experience Lucas-Kanade accuracy might be enough for real-time applications

Knowing the acquisition frequency, you must now find the distance between the successive positions of the marker. 
To find this distance, I suggest you estimate the pose of the marker for each image. Loosely speaking, the "pose" is the 
transformation matrix expressing the coordinates of an object relative to a camera. 


have an image processing project, clearly the title reveals what it is.
Assume I have a camera on top of the one of the traffic lights beside a four way in a heavy crowded city.
 The project should get the recorded video from that camera. Identify the cars on the scene and track their movements.
for the tracking part I believe Lucas Kanade with pyramids or even Lucas Kanade Tomasi would be sufficient.
But before tracking I should Identify the cars coming into the scene. I wonder how I can do that. 
I mean how I can distinguish between people/trees/building/... and cars.
what should I do for identifying ? I want you to be kind enough with me and share your ideas.
